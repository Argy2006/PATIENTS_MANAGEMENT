Problem: Develop the Hospital Patient Record Management System 
Description: The Hospital Patient Record Management System is a software solution designed 
to efficiently manage patient records, emergency queues, billing calculations, and inventory 
operations in a hospital setting. This system leverages linear data structures such as linked lists, 
stacks, and queues to dynamically handle patient admissions, prioritize emergency cases, track 
changes, and perform calculations for billing and inventory management. The assignment 
focuses on implementing these data structures to address real-world hospital management 
scenarios. 
Implementation Sub-Problems 
1. Use linked lists to manage admitted patient records dynamically. 
2. Implement a stack-based undo mechanism for recent admission changes. 
3. Use queues to manage an emergency patient queue using circular and priority queues. 
4. Perform polynomial operations to calculate patient billing based on treatment duration 
and services. 
5. Demonstrate postfix expression evaluation for hospital inventory calculations.

Assignment Instructions 
1. Patient Record ADT Design 
Attributes: 
a) PatientID: Integer, unique identifier for the patient. 
b) PatientName: String, name of the patient. 
c) AdmissionDate: String or custom structure (e.g., day/month/year). 
d) TreatmentDetails: String, details of treatments or services provided. 
Methods: 
a) insertPatient(data): Insert a new patient record into the linked list. 
b) deletePatient(PatientID): Remove a patient record based on the PatientID. 
c) retrievePatient(PatientID): Retrieve patient details for a given PatientID. 
2. Patient Management System 
Attributes: 
a) LinkedList: A linked list to store patient records dynamically. 
b) UndoStack: A stack to store recent admission changes for undo functionality. 
c) EmergencyQueue: A queue (circular or priority) to manage emergency patients. 
Methods: 
a) addPatientRecord(): Add a new patient record to the linked list and update the undo 
stack. 
b) undoAdmission(): Revert the most recent admission change using the stack. 
c) manageEmergencyQueue(): Enqueue and dequeue patients in the emergency queue 
using circular or priority queue logic. 
d) calculateBilling(): Perform polynomial operations to compute billing based on 
treatment duration and services. 
e) evaluateInventory(): Use postfix expression evaluation to calculate hospital 
inventory requirements. 
Implementation Steps 
1. Define the Patient Record ADT with the specified attributes and methods using a linked 
list structure. 
2. Implement a stack-based undo mechanism to track and revert patient admission 
changes. 
3. Develop circular and priority queue implementations to manage the emergency patient 
queue. 
4. Implement polynomial operations for billing calculations based on treatment duration 
and services. 
5. Demonstrate postfix expression evaluation for inventory calculations, ensuring 
accurate computation.
